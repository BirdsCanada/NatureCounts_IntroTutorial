# Loading R Packages {#Package2}



The functionalities of some packages may require updated versions of [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com). To avoid errors, please ensure you are using the most recent releases of R and RStudio, and update your R packages.


```r
update.packages()                         
```

## Installing the NatureCounts package {#Package2.1}

You can install NatureCounts from GitHub with the remotes package:


```r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("BirdStudiesCanada/naturecounts")
```

After installation, you need to load the package each time you open a new R session.


```r
library(naturecounts)
```

## Installing additional packages {#Package2.2}

Throughout the book we use [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), which is a collection of R packages for data science, including tidyr, dplyr, and ggplot2, among others. tidyverse packages can be installed from CRAN and loaded into R as follows:


```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

You may find additional packages are needed to manipulate and visualize your data. For example, if you are interested in [Mapping Observation](https://birdstudiescanada.github.io/naturecounts/articles/articles/mapping-observations.html) a suite of packages need to be installed and loaded. The process is similar to that previously described.
